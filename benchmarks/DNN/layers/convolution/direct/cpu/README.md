The files in this folder are organized as follows:

* General
  - clean.sh : remove some useless files.

  - configure.h: define size of input matrices.

* Halide
  - conv_layer_generator.cpp: Halide code generator (we use it because we want to compare with halide).

* Tiramisu
  - conv_layer_generator_tiramisu.cpp: Tiramisu code generator.

* Wrapper
  - wrapper_nn.cpp: wrapped file that calls the code generated by Tiramisu.
  - wrapper_nn.h

* Intel MKL
