GPU Implementation of sequential matrix multiplication (AxBxC). From the build directory:
- `make run_benchmark_sequential_mm` to run the benchmark.
- `make run_benchmark_sequential_mm_nvprof` to see Nvidia profiles of the kernel.
- `make run_benchmark_sequential_mm_correctness` to run the correctness test.
