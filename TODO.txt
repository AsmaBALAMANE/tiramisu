High Priority
--------------
- Features:
	- Test correctness of blurxy.
    - Add asserts to check my assumptions.
    - Check the correctness of tutorial_02.

	- Halide features:
		- Support reductions.
		- Support type casting.
		- Support updates.
		- Support ramp, broadcast.
		- Create a free and allocate IR nodes.
	- Support non-affine predicates.


- General:
    - split() and interchange() should be done regourously using real ISL
      constraint (floor should be expressed as ISL constraints).
      Now setting the space names is flicky.
    - Work on robust translation from coli accesses into an access function.
      Currently I support only very simple accesses (add, sub).
    - Currently if you specify an access function that has constraints, the
      constraints are not taken in consideration.  The access function is
      applied for all the values of i and j.


- Other features:
	- Support .inline() which inlines computations.    
    - Add scheduling commands: .fuse(), .split(), and .duplicate().
	- Non affine code:
		- Support non affine array accesses.
	- Advantages over Halide:
		- All what min could not do,
		- Fuse/distribute,
		- Mapping to data,



- Halide support
	- compute_halide_call_graph().


- Benchmarks:
	- Image processing (Halide)
		- Blur,
		- Sobel edge detection,
		- Bilateral grid,
		- Camera pipeline,
		- Local Laplacian filters,
		- Multi-scale interpolation,
	- TensorFlow.
	- Simit.




Low Priority
-------------
- Data layout
    - Test buffer access linearization for buffers with more than 3 dimensions.
     Buffer access linearization is now done in
     Computation::create_halide_assignement(std::vector<std::string> &iterators).


- General
   - Currently all loop iterators have an Int32 type.  Users should be able to
   choose which data type they can use (this is important to support loops over
   very large datasets).
   - Create a class "Buffer" to be used instead of using the Halide buffer
   class.  The Halide::Buffer class should only be used during code
   generation.  Currently Halide can only handle 3D arrays, make sure you
   check for this during code generation.
   - Support more isl_ast expressions in create_halide_expr_from_isl_ast_expr.
   - Support data type conversion.  Currently the loop bound (invariant) has
     to be declared explicitely to be "int32_t" in order to have the same
     type as the loop iterator, but in the future automatic data conversion
     should be done.
   - Mark the getter method as const and the returned type of constant (especially
   if you return a pointer) if you don't mean for the user to modify it. For
   example, buffer::get_data returns pointer to data, but I can't really tell
   whether you expect the user to not modify it or if it is okay if I
   re-write the data.
   - Print all the information of a classes.


- Building and compiling
   - ISL, Halide should be distributed with COLi and should be
   compiled automatically.
   - Compile COLi into one shared library.
