Tests
------
- Testing Buffer Declaration
   - Test buffer access linearization for buffers with more than 3 dimensions.
     Buffer access linearization is now done in Computation::create_halide_assignement(std::vector<std::string> &iterators).
    - Check if the declaration of an array with a symbolic constant size is possible.
    - Check if the use of a data dependent array access is possible.

- General
   - Currently all loop iterators have an Int32 type.  Users should be able to choose which data type they can use
     (this is important to support loops over very large datasets).
   - When the user does not provide a schedule or an access function for a
   computation, a default schedule and access functions should be used.
