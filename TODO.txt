- Assumptions:
	- No computation should be added after scheduling.
	- Check that the space of the domain of the access is equal to the
	space of the dmain of the corresponding computation.
	- While in ISL the names of dimensions is not important, the dimension
	names in Tiramisu is important (this is because we need to match the indices
	of tiramisu access expressions to the dimensions of the access function).
