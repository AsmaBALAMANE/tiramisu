- f0.compute_root() in Halide should be translated to
	- Let's assume that f1 is the consumer of f0.
	- f0.before(f1, computation::root_dimension);

- Tuples: translate an assignment of a Tuple to a function
	as the diffinition of multiple computations.
	For example, if you have

	f(i) = Tuple(5,17)

	It should be translated in Tiramisu to two computations

	{f0[i]: 0<=i<N}: 5
	{f1[i]: 0<=i<N}: 17

	Now any reference to f(i).0 (i.e., the first element in
	the tuple f(i)), should be translated into f0(i) or
	something similar.
