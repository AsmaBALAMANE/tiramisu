## Getting Started

- [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) Tiramisu.
- Read the [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md).
- Read the [Tiramisu Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10694).


## Tutorials, Tests and Documentation
#### Run Tutorials

To run all the tutorials, assuming you are in the build/ directory

    make tutorials
    
To run only one tutorial (tutorial_01 for example)

    make run_tutorial_01
    
This will compile and run the code generator and then the wrapper.

#### Run Tests

To run all the tests, assuming you are in the build/ directory

    make test

or

    ctest
    
To run only one test (test_01 for example)

    ctest -R 01

This will compile and run the code generator and then the wrapper.

To view the output of a test pass the `--verbose` option to `ctest`.

To add a new test, add two files in `tests/`.  Assuming `XX` is the number
of the test that you want to add, `test_XX.cpp` should contain
the actual Tiramisu generator code while `wrapper_test_XX.cpp` should contain
wrapper code.  Wrapper code initializes the input data, calls the generated function,
and compares its output with a reference output.  You should then add the
test number `XX` in the file `tests/test_list.txt`.

#### Run Benchmarks

To run all the benchmarks, assuming you are in the build/ directory

    make benchmarks

To run only one benchmark (cvtcolor for example)

    make run_benchmark_cvtcolor

If you want to force the rebuild of a given benchmark, add -B option.

    make -B run_benchmark_cvtcolor

This will rebuild tiramisu, rebuild all the stage of code generation and run
the benchmark.

To add a given benchmark to the build system, add its name in the file
`benchmarks/benchmark_list.txt`.

#### Build Documentation

To build documentation (doxygen required)

    make doc


How To Use Tiramisu
----------------------
Tiramisu provides few classes to enable users to represent their program:
- The `tiramisu::computation` class: a computation is composed of an expression and an iteration space but is not associated with any memory location.
- The `tiramisu::function` class: a function is composed of multiple computations and a vector of arguments (functions arguments).
- The `tiramisu::buffer`: a class to represent memory buffers.

In general, in order to use Tiramisu to optimize, all what a user needs to do is the following:
- Represent the program that needs to be optimized
    - Instantiate a `tiramisu::function`,
    - Instantiate a set of `tiramisu::computation` objects for each function,
- Provide the list of optimizations (memory mapping and schedule)
    - Provide the mapping of each `tiramisu::computation` to memory (i.e. where each computation should be stored in memory),
    - Provide the schedule of each `tiramisu::computation` (a list of loop nest transformations and optimizations such as tiling, parallelization, vectorization, fusion, ...),
- Generate code
    - Generate an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree),
    - Generate target code (an object file),
