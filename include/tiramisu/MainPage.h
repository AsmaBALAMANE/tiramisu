/** \mainpage Documentation of the API if the Tiramisu Compiler
 *
 * Tiramisu provides few classes to enable users to represent their program:
 * - The \ref tiramisu::function class: a function in Tiramisu is equivalent to a function in C. It is composed of multiple computations. Each computation is the equivalent of a statement in C.
 * - The \ref tiramisu::input class: an input is used to represent inputs passed to Tiramisu.  An input can represent a buffer or a scalar.
 * - The \ref tiramisu::constant class: a constant is designed to represent constants that are supposed to be declared at the beginning of a Tiramisu function.
 * - The \ref tiramisu::computation class: a computation in Tiramisu is the equivalent of a statement in C. It is composed of an expression and an iteration domain.
 * - The \ref tiramisu::buffer class: a class to represent memory buffers.
